Welcome to my hometown of Gigantes Island, Carles, Iloilo! I am excited to share with you the beauty and charm of this hidden paradise, as well as the nearby gem of Sicogon Island.

Gigantes Island is a group of islands and islets located in the northern part of Iloilo province. It is known for its stunning beaches, crystal-clear waters, and unique rock formations. As a local, I can attest to the fact that this place is truly one of the most beautiful destinations in the Philippines.
To get to Gigantes Island, you can take a flight to Iloilo City and then drive or take a bus to Carles. From there, you can take a boat to Gigantes Island. The journey may take a few hours, but trust me, it's worth it.

Once you arrive on the island, you'll be greeted by friendly locals who are always ready to welcome visitors with open arms. You can choose to stay in one of the many homestays or resorts on the island. These accommodations are clean, comfortable, and affordable, and they offer a great opportunity to experience the local way of life.

One of the main attractions on Gigantes Island is the Tangke Saltwater Lagoon. This unique natural wonder is a saltwater pool that is surrounded by towering limestone cliffs. You can swim in the clear waters of the lagoon, take photos, and enjoy the stunning views. It's a must-visit spot on the island.

Another popular activity on Gigantes Island is island hopping. You can rent a boat and explore the different islands and islets around Gigantes. You'll get to see more stunning beaches, rock formations, and even visit a few fishing villages along the way. It's a great way to spend a day on the island.

You can enjoy a seafood feast in one of the local restaurants or even join a scallop-harvesting tour where you'll get to catch your own scallops and cook them on the spot.
Now, let's talk about Sicogon Island. This beautiful island is located just a short boat ride away from Gigantes Island. It boasts stunning beaches, crystal-clear waters, and lush greenery. It's a perfect place to unwind and escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

To get to Sicogon Island, you can take a boat from Gigantes Island or Carles. The boat ride takes around 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your starting point.
